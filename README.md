# Rule-Based Chatbot
## Introduction
The Rule-Based Chatbot project is designed to interact with users based on predefined rules and responses. This chatbot uses simple pattern matching techniques to identify user inputs and generate appropriate responses.

## How It Works
The chatbot operates through two main components:

Pattern Matching: The chatbot identifies user input by matching it against predefined patterns using regular expressions.
Response Generation: When a pattern is matched, the chatbot responds with a corresponding predefined message.
